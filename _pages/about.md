Zhaohui Wang, a doctoral candidate at the [Beijing Aerospace Propulsion Research Institute](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E8%88%AA%E5%A4%A9%E5%8A%A8%E5%8A%9B%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E6%89%80/6043802), under the [China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology](http://calt.spacechina.com/). My research focuses on aeronautical and astronautical science and technology, with a specialization in the design, manufacturing, and testing of high-pressure safety valves for aerospace propulsion systems.

Currently, I am working under the supervision of Professor [Dianjing Chen](https://xueshu.baidu.com/scholarID/CN-BF74MULJ), with an emphasis on improving the reliability, efficiency, and safety of aerospace fluid control components. My long-term research goal is to advance high-performance valve technologies that support the next generation of launch vehicles and space exploration missions.
